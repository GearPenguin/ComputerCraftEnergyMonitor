# ComputerCraftEnergyMonitor

Needs to be connected to an advanced monitor and a mekanism induction cell port.

Intended for use on a 5x3 monitor.

Right clicking the screen switches between display modes. Sometimes you have to click more than once... probably something to do with events not being added to the queue when pullEvent hasn't been called yet.
